# complex_library
  A library in (C) for complex numbers.
  
# how to use it

  You have 2 files: **libcomplex.a**, **libcomplex.so**. A static library and a dynamic library, respectively.
  
  . To use the static library just copy the file and compile your code:
  
      > $ gcc -Wall use_complex.c -o use_complex -L. -lcomplex -lm     
         
        (-L.) if it is in your current directory
        
   
  . To use the dynamic one, just do the same thing like the static:
  
    > $ gcc -Wall use_complex.c -o use_complex -L. -lcomplex -lm
    
 
  Depending on the operating system you are using, you may have to run the command (For the library to be found):
  
    > $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
      
 # some other info
 
  In the code folder you will found the implementation for the differents functions that the library contains.
